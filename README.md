# HopfieldNetwork
Implementation of Hopfield Network by using Matlab üíª
Firstly, open data_hopfield.m 
Secondly, run the code
Finally, run the asy_hopfield or syn_hopfield. Asy means asynchronous method, syn means synchronous method.
Conclusion: In this study, we reveal significant differences between the two updating strategies in terms of network
convergence and matching results by comparing the performance of asynchronous and synchronous
methods in Hopfield networks. Our results show that the asynchronous method performs better
in terms of matching results with clear patterns, despite the fact that it requires a higher number
of iterations (600). This confirms the effectiveness of the asynchronous update mechanism in the
stepwise search energy minimization process.
Comparatively, the synchronous method, although it has a significant advantage in terms of the
number of iterations, converging in only 3 iterations, has poorer matching results. This suggests that
sacrificing matching quality for speed may not be optimal in some cases.
Overall, the asynchronous update approach allows the network to escape from the local optimal
solution more efficiently and find the global optimum or a better local optimal solution. While the
synchronous update approach is easy to fall into the local optimal solution. Therefore asynchronous
updating is more effective than synchronous updating.‚è≤Ô∏è
